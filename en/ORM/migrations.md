## Introduction

When multiple people collaborate to develop applications, if there is no unified specification for the synchronization database structure to ensure that everyone's local data is consistent, it will be a disaster. Database migration is to solve this problem. The database structure is version controlled to ensure the consistency of the database structure of all developers.

Goravel's data migration function is supported by the well-known [golang-migrate/migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate).

## Create Migrations

Use the `make:migration` command to create the migration:
`go run . artisan make:migration create_users_table`

This command will generate migration files in the `database/migrations` directory. All migration files start with a timestamp. Goravel will use this as the execution order of the migration files. All migration files are `.sql` files, and you can customize the table structure using SQL statements.

The migration command will generate two migration files at the same time: `***.up.sql` and `***.down.sql`, respectively corresponding to execution and rollback. (The rollback function will be supported in future versions)

## Quickly Create

Using `craete_users_table` will automatically generate a table containing the infrastructure of `users`:
```
CREATE TABLE users (
  id bigint(20) unsigned NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  created_at datetime(3) DEFAULT NULL,
  updated_at datetime(3) DEFAULT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (id),
  KEY idx_users_created_at (created_at),
  KEY idx_users_updated_at (updated_at)
) ENGINE = InnoDB AUTO_INCREMENT = 1 DEFAULT CHARSET = DummyDatabaseCharset;
```

The realization principle is to match according to the regularity:
```
^create_(\w+)_table$
^create_(\w+)$
```

Using `add_avatar_to_users_table` will automatically generate a structure for adding fields to the `users` table:
```
ALTER TABLE users ADD column varchar(255) COMMENT '';
```

The realization principle is to match according to the regularity:
```
_(to|from|in)_(\w+)_table$
_(to|from|in)_(\w+)$
```

When the above conditions are not matched, the framework will generate an empty migration file.
